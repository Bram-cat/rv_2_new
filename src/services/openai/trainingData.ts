### Summary

The video explores the **power of the human voice** as a unique and influential instrument capable of evoking profound human emotions and actions—from starting wars to expressing love. Despite this potential, many people struggle to be heard effectively. The speaker identifies common communication pitfalls, termed the **“seven deadly sins of speaking,”** and then offers a positive framework alongside practical vocal techniques to enhance speaking power and impact.

### Seven Deadly Sins of Speaking

These are widespread negative speaking habits that diminish the effectiveness of communication:

- **Gossip:** Speaking ill of absent others, which is harmful and cyclical.
- **Judging:** Creating an atmosphere where listeners feel criticized, hindering open communication.
- **Negativity:** Persistent pessimism or complaining, which drains listener engagement.
- **Complaining:** A cultural habit (notably in the UK) that spreads misery rather than positivity.
- **Excuses:** Avoiding responsibility by blaming others, which erodes credibility.
- **Embroidery/Exaggeration:** Overstating facts leads to distrust and resembles lying.
- **Dogmatism:** Confusing opinions with facts, making it hard for listeners to engage with reasoned dialogue.

### Positive Foundation for Powerful Speaking: H.A.I.L.

The speaker proposes **four cornerstones** that create a foundation for impactful and change-making speech. These form the acronym **HAIL**, defined as "to greet or acclaim enthusiastically," reflecting how effective speech should be received:

| Letter | Meaning          | Description                                                                                     |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| H      | Honesty          | Being truthful, clear, and straightforward in communication.                                   |
| A      | Authenticity     | Being genuine and standing in your own truth without pretense.                                |
| I      | Integrity        | Following through on your word; being reliable and trustworthy.                               |
| L      | Love             | Wishing others well, tempering honesty with kindness, and avoiding judgment.                   |

### Vocal Toolbox: Enhancing How You Speak

Beyond what you say, **how you say it** is crucial. The speaker highlights several vocal tools that can increase the power and persuasiveness of speech:

- **Register:** Speaking from the chest voice adds authority and weight; lower voices are often perceived as more powerful.
- **Timbre:** The texture or "feel" of the voice; warm, smooth voices are generally preferred and can be developed with training.
- **Prosody:** The melodic and rhythmic aspects of speech that convey meaning and emotion; avoiding monotone delivery is key.
- **Pace:** Varying speed to emphasize points; speaking too fast or too slow can impact understanding.
- **Silence:** Strategic pauses increase impact and allow listeners to absorb information.
- **Pitch:** Changes in pitch add emotional nuance and can alter meaning.
- **Volume:** Adjusting loudness to command attention or draw listeners in; avoid constant loudness ("sodcasting").

### Vocal Warm-Up Exercises

To prepare the voice for effective communication, the speaker recommends six simple exercises that enhance vocal flexibility and clarity:

- Deep breath with arms raised and sighing out "ahhhh."
- Lip trills: repeating “Ba, Ba, Ba.”
- Lip vibrations: “brrrrr” sounds.
- Tongue exercises: exaggerated “la, la, la.”
- Rolling the R sound “rrrrrr” (tongue trill).
- The “siren” exercise: sliding from a high "we" to a low "aw" sound.

These exercises help "warm up" the voice before important speaking occasions.

### Key Insight and Closing Reflection

The speaker emphasizes that **effective communication requires conscious effort both in speech production and listening environments**. Currently, many conversations suffer due to inattentive listeners and poor acoustic settings. He envisions a world where:

- People speak powerfully and listen consciously.
- Sound is created, consumed, and designed thoughtfully.
- Understanding becomes the norm rather than the exception.

This vision underscores the social and cultural importance of improving vocal communication.

### Summary
The video is a comprehensive workshop on effective spontaneous speaking, emphasizing practical techniques to manage anxiety and improve communication in unplanned speaking situations. The speaker begins by highlighting the common difficulty of noticing details under pressure through a simple exercise involving counting the letter "f" in a sentence. This serves as an analogy for how even intelligent people overlook important elements when stressed, similar to public speaking.

The core focus is on spontaneous speaking, which occurs when individuals are required to speak off the cuff without prior preparation, such as during Q&A sessions, surprise toasts, or introductions. The workshop is designed to help participants handle anxiety, reframe speaking situations as opportunities, and develop skills to respond confidently and effectively.

Anxiety management is the first key area. The speaker discusses the universal nature of public speaking anxiety, present in about 85% of people, and introduces three research-backed techniques: greeting anxiety to acknowledge and normalize it, reframing speaking as a conversation rather than a performance, and becoming present-oriented using activities like physical movement, counting backward, or tongue twisters.

The workshop then moves into four critical steps to improve spontaneous speaking. The first is to get out of your own way by resisting the urge to be perfect, exemplified by a playful activity called “shout the wrong name,” designed to help speakers let go of overthinking. The second step is to reframe the speaking scenario as an opportunity rather than a threat, which encourages openness and creativity. This is practiced through a gift-giving improvisation game that fosters spontaneity and fun.

The third step emphasizes slowing down and active listening. Participants play a spelling game to practice focused listening, which prevents premature responses and enhances understanding of the audience’s needs. The fourth step introduces the importance of structure in spontaneous speaking. The speaker presents two simple but effective frameworks—problem, solution, benefit, and what, so what, now what—that help organize thoughts and improve message clarity.

Throughout, the speaker stresses practicing these techniques to build comfort and competence. The session concludes with a Q&A addressing hostile situations, remote audiences, expert witness testimony, cross-cultural communication, the use of humor, and journalistic questioning strategies. The speaker also promotes his book, *Speaking Up Without Freaking Out*, and an online resource, NoFreakingSpeaking.com, for further learning.

### Highlights
- [00:01:00] 🧠 The “f” counting exercise illustrates how anxiety impairs perception and performance.
- [00:04:40] 😰 Anxiety affects 85% of people in public speaking; managing—not eliminating—it is key.
- [00:09:00] 🗣️ Reframing public speaking as a conversation reduces pressure and improves engagement.
- [00:17:40] 🎲 The “shout the wrong name” game helps speakers get out of their own way and overcome perfectionism.
- [00:26:20] 🎁 The gift exchange improvisation game reframes spontaneous speaking as an opportunity.
- [00:34:50] 👂 Active listening is critical; slow down and fully understand before responding.
- [00:39:20] 🏗️ Using simple structures like Problem-Solution-Benefit and What-So What-Now What enhances clarity and audience retention.

### Key Insights
- [00:01:00] 🔍 The initial “f” counting exercise is a powerful metaphor for how cognitive overload can cause us to miss obvious details under stress. This parallels how anxiety affects spontaneous speaking, where nervousness can lead to missing key points or stumbling.
  
- [00:04:40] ⚡ Anxiety in public speaking is nearly universal, but it can be harnessed as a source of energy rather than a debilitating force. The speaker’s emphasis on managing anxiety through mindful acknowledgment and reframing helps prevent the downward spiral of nervousness.

- [00:09:00] 💬 Viewing public speaking as a conversation rather than a performance shifts the mindset from fear of judgment to engagement. This reduces the pressure to be perfect and encourages authentic interaction, making speakers more relatable and audiences more receptive.

- [00:17:40] 🧩 The “shout the wrong name” game disrupts ingrained cognitive patterns and encourages spontaneous responses without overthinking. This exercise helps break the mental habit of trying to be perfect, which often paralyzes spontaneous speakers.

- [00:26:20] 🎭 The gift-giving improvisation game not only lightens the mood but also trains participants to embrace unpredictability and creativity. It models how spontaneous speaking can be a shared, enjoyable experience rather than a threat.

- [00:34:50] 🎧 The spelling game underscores the importance of active listening in communication. By forcing participants to slow down and focus fully on what their partner is saying, it highlights how true listening leads to more accurate and thoughtful responses.

- [00:39:20] 🏗️ Structured communication significantly improves both speaker confidence and audience comprehension. The two frameworks presented—Problem-Solution-Benefit and What-So What-Now What—are versatile tools that reduce cognitive load by providing a clear path for organizing ideas quickly in spontaneous settings.

- [00:49:20] 🛡️ Handling hostile questions or situations requires preparation and composure. Acknowledging emotions without naming them explicitly, reframing the question, and using paraphrasing techniques buys time and defuses tension, enabling more effective responses.

- [00:51:20] 🌐 Remote and culturally diverse audiences demand mindful engagement strategies. Incorporating interactive elements like polls, collaborative tools, and culturally sensitive approaches enhances connection and participation in virtual or multicultural settings.

- [00:56:00] 😂 Humor, while a powerful tool to connect and engage, carries risks, especially across cultures. Self-deprecating humor is safest, and speakers should always have a backup plan if a joke falls flat to avoid alienation or awkwardness.

- [00:57:00] ❓ For journalists or questioners facing media-trained speakers, the “power of why” and asking for advice can elicit more authentic and detailed answers by changing the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative.

### Conclusion
This workshop provides a rich, research-based toolkit for mastering spontaneous speaking. By managing anxiety, shifting mindset, embracing imperfection, actively listening, and using clear structures, speakers can transform spontaneous speaking from a source of fear into a platform for confident, authentic communication. The practical exercises and improvisational techniques make these abstract concepts tangible, helping participants build real-world skills that apply across professional and personal contexts. The inclusion of a Q&A session also addresses common challenges, ensuring the advice is relevant and actionable for a broad audience.


[00:00:00]  
**Summary of the Experiment Introduction and Initial Reactions**  
The speaker introduces an intriguing social experiment: after leaving the room, participants are asked to approach a stranger and pose the question, **“When was the last time you cried in front of someone?”**, then share their own answer. The audience initially shows reluctance and discomfort with this idea, which the speaker acknowledges as natural given the vulnerability and awkwardness involved. However, the speaker promises that engaging in this experiment will be worthwhile and beneficial, improving one’s life through deeper human connection.

---

[00:01:05]  
**Personal Story Illustrating Communication Challenges**  
The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a recurring conflict pattern with his wife after 20 years of marriage. He would complain about his workday and lack of appreciation, while his wife offered practical advice. Instead of listening, he became defensive and emotional, expecting support rather than solutions, which led to frustration on both sides. This story sets the stage for exploring why communication often fails even when both parties have legitimate points.

---

[00:01:55]  
**Core Insight: Communication Contains Multiple Simultaneous Conversations**  
The speaker explains insights from communication research, revealing that a single conversation often includes multiple layers or types of dialogue simultaneously:  
- **Practical conversations:** Focused on facts and problem-solving (e.g., “What is this about?”)  
- **Emotional conversations:** Focused on sharing feelings without seeking solutions, aiming for empathy  
- **Social conversations:** About identity, relationship dynamics, and social roles  

The failure to recognize which layer is active leads to people talking past one another, as happened in the speaker’s marriage.

---

[00:02:51]  
**The Matching Principle in Communication**  
This concept, known as the **matching principle**, states that successful communication requires participants to identify and align with the type of conversation occurring. If one person engages practically while the other is emotional, true understanding fails. Schools teach this by encouraging teachers to ask students whether they want practical help, an emotional connection, or simply to be heard. Though effective in controlled settings, this approach is difficult to apply casually in everyday life.

---

[00:03:47]  
**Using Deep Questions to Facilitate Matching Conversations**  
Since explicitly asking “Do you want a hug?” or “Do you want to be heard?” is often inappropriate, the speaker proposes another tool: asking **deep questions**. These questions invite discussion of values, beliefs, feelings, and personal experiences rather than surface-level facts. Examples include:  
- Instead of “Where do you work?” ask “What do you love about your job?”  
- Instead of “Where did you go to high school?” ask “What was high school like for you?”  

Such questions encourage people to reveal their authentic selves and foster vulnerability, which promotes reciprocal openness and connection.

---

[00:04:48]  
**The Power of Vulnerability in Connection**  
Deep questions evoke vulnerability, which is the key to forming meaningful connections. When one person shares vulnerably and the other responds in kind, emotional bonds form. This mutual vulnerability helps people understand each other’s desires, identities, and emotional needs, strengthening communication beyond superficial exchanges.

---

[00:05:20]  
**Case Study: Dr. Behfar Ehdaie and Prostate Cancer Patients**  
The speaker introduces Dr. Behfar Ehdaie, a New York City cancer surgeon specializing in prostate cancer, who faced a perplexing problem: despite his medical advice recommending **active surveillance** (monitoring the cancer rather than immediate surgery), many patients insisted on surgery. This was counterintuitive since surgery posed significant risks and the cancer often grew extremely slowly. 

---

[00:06:23]  
**Challenges of Medical Decision-Making and Communication**  
Dr. Ehdaie observed that patients’ insistence on surgery was not about medical facts but deeper emotional and social concerns. Patients feared the stigma of cancer, the impact on their careers, and broader anxieties about their families and the future. When patients repeatedly rejected his advice, he realized the communication approach needed to change.

---

[00:07:23]  
**Shift in Approach Using Deep Questions**  
After consulting with Harvard Business School professors, Dr. Ehdaie began asking patients **deep questions** instead of jumping to medical advice. For example, he asked, “What does this cancer diagnosis mean to you?” This opened space for patients to share their fears, identity concerns, and emotional burdens rather than focusing narrowly on medical facts.

---

[00:07:54]  
**Emotional Conversation Leads to Better Outcomes**  
In one case, a 62-year-old patient revealed fears unrelated to cancer itself, such as his father’s death, worries about workplace perception, and concerns for his grandchildren’s future. Dr. Ehdaie responded empathetically, sharing his own experiences of family illness, which created an emotional connection. After spending eight minutes on this emotional conversation, he transitioned to practical medical options, and the patient chose active surveillance.

---

[00:09:30]  
**Results of Deeper Communication in Medical Context**  
This new approach dramatically increased patient acceptance of recommended treatments. Dr. Ehdaie’s success highlights the importance of recognizing which conversation is occurring—emotional, social, or practical—and responding accordingly. This case illustrates how deep questions and emotional engagement can improve not just personal but also professional communication outcomes.

---

[00:10:03]  
**Revisiting the Initial Experiment and Its Impact**  
The speaker returns to the original experiment: asking strangers about the last time they cried in front of someone and then sharing one’s own experience. This experiment has been conducted in formal studies, notably by Nick Epley at the University of Chicago, where participants initially resist but ultimately report profound connection and positive feelings afterward.

---

[00:10:31]  
**Participants’ Reactions and Effects of the Deep Question**  
After asking and answering the emotional question, participants frequently say they felt:  
- **More connected** to the other person than in recent interactions  
- **More cared for and caring**  
- They experienced **attentive listening** and ease in conversation  

Almost all participants describe this as one of the best conversations they had in a long time, highlighting the power of the right question with a stranger.

---

[00:11:28]  
**Why Deep Questions Are Powerful for Connection**  
The reason the experiment works is that deep questions:  
- Encourage sharing of authentic, meaningful experiences  
- Reveal underlying emotions, values, and identities  
- Help people identify which type of conversation is happening  
- Enable vulnerability, which fosters reciprocal openness and connection  

This approach counters modern social fragmentation by restoring meaningful dialogue.

---

[00:12:07]  
**The Science and Skill of Communication**  
The speaker notes that **super communicators**—people who excel at connecting—do so not because of innate charisma or extroversion, but because they have learned specific communication skills. These skills include recognizing conversation types, asking deep questions, and fostering vulnerability. Such abilities can be learned by anyone.

---

[00:12:38]  
**Conclusion and Call to Action**  
The speaker encourages the audience to practice this experiment by finding a stranger, asking the question about crying, and sharing their own experience. This simple act can spark profound human connection. The emotional reward felt after such conversations is deeply embedded in human brain evolution, underscoring our innate need for connection.

**Final takeaway:**  
**Asking deep, vulnerable questions is a scientifically supported method to overcome communication barriers, build empathy, and create meaningful connections—even with strangers.**

This summary provides a comprehensive, structured overview of the video content, emphasizing **the science of communication, the power of vulnerability, and the practical application of deep questions to foster genuine human connection**.
[00:00:00] **Patrick Winston opens by emphasizing the critical importance of communication skills for success in life**, equating the ability to speak and write well—and the quality of one's ideas—as fundamental tools, akin to weapons for soldiers. He proposes that just as military officers are held accountable for sending soldiers into battle unarmed, students should similarly be equipped with strong communication skills before facing the world.

[00:00:57] **Winston introduces a formula for effective communication:** it depends primarily on the amount of knowledge (K) one has, the amount of practice (P) with that knowledge, and a much smaller role played by inherent talent (T). He illustrates this with a personal anecdote comparing his skiing skills to Olympic gymnast Mary Lou Retton’s novice skiing, showing that knowledge and practice can outweigh natural talent.

[00:02:13] **His key promise to the audience is that learning even one new speaking heuristic or technique from the talk could be the difference in their success, highlighting the non-linear nature of improvement through accumulated knowledge.**

[00:02:49] Over the next hour, Winston promises exposure to various speaking strategies that will help maximize the acceptance and appreciation of ideas. He sets a **"rule of engagement" prohibiting laptops and cell phones** during the session to ensure full attention, citing cognitive limitations of human "language processors" and studies showing distractions reduce effectiveness for both the distracted person and those nearby.

[00:04:09] **On how to start a talk, Winston advises against opening with a joke, because audiences need time to adjust to the speaker’s vocal and presentation style and are usually not ready for humor immediately.** Instead, he recommends starting with an **"empowerment promise"**—telling the audience what new knowledge or ability they will gain by the end of the talk.

[00:05:36] Winston then introduces several heuristics he regularly uses in presentations:

- **Cycling on the subject:** Repeat key points multiple times (e.g., three times) because typically about 20% of the audience will be distracted or “fogged out” at any moment.
- **Building a fence around ideas:** Clearly distinguish your ideas from others’ to avoid confusion, for example by comparing your approach to others technically.
- **Verbal punctuation:** Use explicit markers or enumeration to signal transitions and help the audience reorient themselves.
- **Asking questions:** Engages the audience and provides natural pauses; carefully crafted questions should not be too easy or too difficult, and seven seconds is an effective maximum pause length to wait for a response.

[00:10:06] **He encourages building a personal repertoire of such heuristics by observing admired speakers and adapting techniques to develop one’s own style.**

[00:10:53] Winston discusses **optimal timing and venue for talks:** 

- **Best time:** Around 11 a.m., when most people are alert and not post-meal or fatigued.
- **Venue lighting:** The room should be well-lit because dim lighting signals the brain to relax or fall asleep.
- **Familiarity with the venue:** Speakers should "case" the place beforehand to avoid surprises.
- **Audience size:** The room should be reasonably filled (more than half full) to maintain engagement and social pressure on the audience.

[00:13:49] On **boards, props, and slides as tools of communication:**

- **Blackboards:** Preferred for teaching and informing because they support graphics, writing speed aligns with audience processing, and provide a "target" for the speaker’s hands, reducing distracting gestures.
- **Props:** Playwrights are masters of using props to symbolize and build tension (e.g., Henrik Ibsen’s potbellied stove in "Hedda Gabler"). Winston shares examples such as Seymour Papert’s use of a spinning bicycle wheel to demonstrate mechanical principles, which helps the audience “feel” the concept via empathetic mirroring.
- **Empathetic mirroring:** He theorizes that physically seeing actions (writing on a board, moving props) activates mirror neurons in the brain, enhancing understanding and engagement more than static slides or pictures.

[00:23:57] **Slides are primarily for exposing ideas, not teaching them.** Winston criticizes common slide presentation errors:

- **Too many slides and words:** Overloads the audience and shifts attention from the speaker to the slide text.
- **Reading slides aloud:** Annoys audiences who can read themselves.
- **Distance from slides:** Standing far away and shifting gaze between slides and audience causes disengagement.
- **Clutter and small fonts:** Fonts smaller than about 35-40 points invite too much text and reduce readability.
- **Laser pointer misuse:** Excessive or awkward use breaks eye contact and reduces engagement.

He advises **removing unnecessary background, logos, and titles, reducing words drastically, and using slides as "condiments" rather than the main event.**

[00:28:28] He cites a student experiment where students remembered **more what they read on slides than what was spoken**, leading to distraction from the speaker. Consequently, reducing slide text helps the audience listen better.

[00:29:44] Regarding laser pointers, he illustrates how their use often causes loss of eye contact and attention, and suggests alternatives like embedding arrows on the slide itself to direct attention.

[00:32:31] Comparing slides, he shows a **"too-heavy" example with dense text and small fonts** versus a **"light" example with mostly images and ample white space**, which improves audience focus and comprehension.

[00:33:44] He introduces the term **hapax legomenon**, meaning a slide or idea used exactly once in a presentation to highlight something complex or unique, such as an intricate diagram explaining governance in Afghanistan.

[00:34:32] Winston humorously demonstrates that these slide presentation errors do occur, showing examples of poor venue and audience disengagement, including an 80-slide presentation with multiple conclusion slides and distracted attendees.

[00:36:38] Transitioning to **special cases and inspiring students,** Winston shares findings from his survey:

- Incoming freshmen were inspired by high school teachers who believed in them.
- Senior faculty were inspired when someone helped them see a problem in a new way.
- **Passion from the speaker is a universal source of inspiration.**

He notes his own enthusiasm for artificial intelligence naturally helps in inspiring others.

[00:39:04] He gives an example of a lecture on **resource allocation and graph coloring**, demonstrating how computational complexity can be made engaging by setting expectations upfront and expressing excitement about the results.

[00:40:20] On teaching people how to think, Winston believes **humans are storytelling animals**, learning and thinking through stories formed in childhood and developed professionally. Effective teaching involves providing stories, questions, analytical tools, and reliability assessments.

[00:42:17] Discussing **persuasion and oral exams,** he identifies key reasons for oral exam failures:

- Failure to situate one’s research in context.
- Failure to practice adequately.

He warns against practicing exclusively with knowledgeable faculty who may "hallucinate" material that isn’t presented, and recommends practicing with friends unfamiliar with the topic who can give honest feedback.

[00:44:35] Winston recounts a conversation with colleagues about job talks, highlighting two critical criteria faculty look for in candidates:

| Criterion   | Explanation                                         | Timeframe to Demonstrate  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Vision      | Show a compelling problem and novel approach       | Within 5 minutes          |
| Demonstrated Achievement | Show evidence of having done meaningful work | Within 5 minutes          |

He stresses that failure to establish vision and accomplishments quickly results in losing the audience.

[00:46:13] He illustrates his personal **stump speech on human intelligence,** emphasizing:

- Humans are symbolic creatures capable of building stories.
- Research focuses on what differentiates human intelligence from that of chimpanzees and Neanderthals.
- Contribution is shown by enumerating steps to solve the problem, including specifying behavior, enumerating constraints, implementing systems, and demonstrating results.

[00:48:45] On **getting famous (recognition),** Winston explains why it matters: ideas are like children and deserve to be well-packaged and recognized. He introduces **"Winston’s Star"**, a mnemonic for key elements that make research memorable—all starting with S:

| Element   | Description                                                 | Example from Winston’s Arch Learning Work          |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Symbol    | A distinctive icon or representation                        | The arch itself                                   |
| Slogan    | A catchy phrase summarizing the concept                      | "One shot learning"                               |
| Surprise  | An unexpected insight or result                              | Learning from one example, not many               |
| Salient Idea | A standout, memorable concept (not necessarily important) | The notion of a "near miss"                        |
| Story     | Narrative explaining the research, importance, and process  | How the arch learning system works and why it matters |

[00:54:01] On **how to end a talk,** Winston critiques typical final slides and closing words:

- Avoid a **collaborators slide at the end,** as it dilutes personal recognition; place collaborators on the first slide instead.
- Avoid leaving the slide blank or with a "Thank you" only—this is a weak ending.
- Avoid the common practice of reading conclusions that the audience does not care about.
- Prefer a **"contributions" slide** that mirrors the initial framing and highlights what you have done.

[00:56:56] Regarding final words:

- A joke can be effective at the end since the audience is now engaged.
- Saying "Thank you" or "Thank you for listening" is weak as it implies the audience stayed out of politeness rather than interest.
- Instead, consider more powerful closings, such as a benediction or a "salute" acknowledging the audience and expressing appreciation.

[00:58:57] Winston shows examples from political speeches (Chris Christie and Bill Clinton) where the speakers avoid "thank you" and end with a **blessing or rallying cry,** reinforcing a strong, memorable close.

[01:01:37] He notes how various traditions (Latin mass, musical concerts) have conventions signaling the event is over without explicit verbal thanks, and he suggests you can similarly use a nonverbal or appreciative close.

[01:02:23] Finally, Winston models a **salute to the audience,** thanking them for their engagement, expressing eagerness to return, and encouraging them to bring friends next time—closing with humor and warmth.

[01:03:04] **In conclusion, Winston praises the audience for recognizing the importance of how ideas are presented and packaged, salutes their commitment, and invites them to continue learning and sharing.**
